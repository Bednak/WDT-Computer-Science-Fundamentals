> Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;
Washing dishes;
A choice of your own.


FUNCTION MakeCoffee
	IF frenchPress is NOT clean
		CLEAN frenchPress
	END IF	
	IF grinder is empty
		GET coffeeBeans
		INPUT coffeeBeans in grinder
		GRIND coffeeBeans
		INSERT coffeeBeans INTO frenchPress
	ELSE grinder is full
		INSERT coffeeBeans INTO frenchPress
	END IF
	IF water != boiled
		BOIL water
	END IF
	POUR water INTO frenchPress
	WHILE timeBrewed < 3 minutes
		RETREIVE creamer
		INCREMENT timeBrewed by second
	END WHILE
	IF timeBrewed > 3 minutes
		POUR coffee into mug
		ADD creamer
	END IF	
END FUNCTION




FUNCTION washDishes
	IF sink IS overflowing with dishes
		TURN on hot water
	ELSE ignore dishes
	END IF
	WHILE hot water is running
		SCRUB each dish with dish soap
		RINSE all dish soap off
		DRY each dish
		SET in drying rack
		IF sink == empty
			TURN OFF hot water
		END IF
	END WHILE
END FUNCTION

	

FUNCTION  makeGrilledCheese
	SET pan on stove 
		IF pan != coated in butter
			SPREAD butter in pan
		END IF
	SET heat on medium
		WHILE heat heat is on medium
			SPREAD butter on 2 bread slices
			SPREAD cheese on 2 bread slices
			SET bread in pan
			IF bread IS toasted on both sides
			TURN off heat
			END IF
		END WHILE
	REMOVE bread from pan
END FUNCTION

> As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

Netflix is a big user of algorithms. They were one of the first and most prevalent companies to stream digitally. Their algorithms gather information on the tv shows and movies 
a user watches and finds new shows or movies that the user would find appealing. This allows the user to be satisfied with what they are watching.

Reddit uses an algorithm to drive articles and user content to the front page of their website. The algorithm checks how many people are voted and how fast it's being voted on.
This allows the most important and hottest content to rise to the top. 

Facebook is soley built from using their algorithms. They see what content a user is interested in and tailor specific marketing toward that person based on their intersts and hobbies.


3.

> Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

An efficient algorithm will value speed and accuracy above everything. You want an algorithm that does not make mistakes (or minimizes), as these can be costly, however, it needs to fast
as a slow alogorithm would no be an effective tool when time is short. Striking a balance between these two is important.
