Exercises

1.

> What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

An example would be searching for a specific Olympic athlete to see how many medals they won. You would need to go through each one as they are not
organized in any specific way. 

2.

> What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

3. An example would be searching for a specific book title at the library. If the titles are arranged in alphabetical order, you can start in the middle
and eliminate the half that your book does not start with. 

> Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

It would take 7 as we start with A


4.

> Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

It would take 3 as we start with D

5.

> Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

We would need to use a linear search because we can only use a binary search on a sorted list.


6.

> Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

We would definitely want to use a binary search. The collection is sorted so we can discard half of the collection that does not meet our criteria. 



Programming Assignment:

1. 

> You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.


function dictionarySearch(array, word){ 
  
    let first = 0;
    let last = array.length - 1; 
         
    while (first <= last){ 
          
        let middle = Math.floor((first + last) / 2); 
            
        if (array[middle] === word){
          
          return "Found: " + word; 
        }
      
        else if (array[middle] < word){  
          
          first = middle + 1; 
        }
      
        else{
          
          last = middle - 1; 
       }
    } 
   
    return "Your word was not in the dictionary"; 
} 


var dictionary = ["Aardvark","Albatross", "Anaconda", "Bat", "Camel",
               "Eagle", "Zebra"];

console.log(dictionarySearch(dictionary, "Albatross"));
console.log(dictionarySearch(dictionary, "Dog"));



7.

> You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.


function catchFish(array, fish){
  
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
   
    if (array[i] === fish){
    
      return "You caught the fish!";
    }
  }
  return "The fish does not appear to be in the tank";
}

var fishTank = ["Japanese Ryukin", "Shubunkin", "Broadtail Moor", 
			"Bubble Eye", "Celestial", "White-spotted Goldfish", "Fancy Fantail"];

console.log(catchFish(fishTank, "White-spotted Goldfish"));
console.log(catchFish(fishTank, "Puffer Fish"));
