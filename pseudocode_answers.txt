Short Answer 
1. Programmers use pseudocode because it helps them develop algorithms. These algorithms can be brainstormed regardless of the programming language used by the end product.   
2. Running pseudocode on your computer would do nothing. It is simply text that is not meant to be read by machines.  

Programming Assignment

1. 
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number
	PRINT  first number is the greater number
ELSE IF the second number is greater than the first number
	PRINT second number is the greater number
ELSE 
	PRINT first number and second number are the same
END IF

2.
number = 1
WHILE number is <= 100
	PRINT number
	ADD 1 to number
ENDWHILE

3.
INPUT phone number
SET foundNum to false
FOR each entry in the directory
	IF phone number matches number in directory
		PRINT phone number and name
		SET foundNum to true
        END IF
ENDFOR
IF foundNum is false
	PRINT the phone number does not exist in directory
END IF
